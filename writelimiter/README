Prototype of writelimiter:
    syscall_limiter forbids using open with writing flag,
    libwritelimiter.so redirects failed opens to writelimiter_broker
    writelimiter_broker checks path, does the actual open and sends FD into sandbox
    
Current limitations:
1. Only open and creat functions are considered
2. Access only to /tmp, using absolute pathnames
3. Security is not thought thought
4. Using hardcoded FD numbers: 33 and 34
5. After finishing, writelimiter_broker stays around waiting forever
6. Tested only on my system. 

Example:
$ ./writelimiter /bin/bash -c "echo qqq > www"
/bin/bash: www: Permission denied
$ ./writelimiter /bin/bash -c "echo qqq > /tmp/www"
$ ./writelimiter /bin/bash -c "echo qqq > /tmp/../tmp/www"
/bin/bash: /tmp/../tmp/www: Permission denied
$ killall writelimiter_broker
