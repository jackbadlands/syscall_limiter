Prototype of writelimiter:
    syscall_limiter forbids using open with writing flag,
    libwritelimiter.so redirects failed opens to writelimiter_broker
    writelimiter_broker does the actual open and sends FD into sandbox
    
Current limitations:
1. Only open and creat functions are considered
2. Access only to /tmp, using absolute pathnames
3. No protection against ../../..
4. Using hardcoded FD numbers: 33 and 34
