Prototype of writelimiter:
    syscall_limiter forbids using open with writing flag,
    libwritelimiter.so redirects failed opens to writelimiter_broker
    writelimiter_broker consults with policy_prog and does the actual open and sends FD into sandbox
    
Current limitations:
1. Security is not thought thought yet;
2. Uses hardcoded FD numbers: 33 and 34;
3. UNIX sockets connections are not monitored; 
    read access is just granted everywhere;
         (we need it to allow dynamically linked binaries to work)
    execve is allowed everywhere.
4. Tested mostly on my system.

Example:
$ POLICY="perl -ne '
    INIT{$|=1;}  
    print 0 and next if /\.\./; 
    print 1 and next if m@/tmp/@; 
    print 1 and next if m@^/dev/null@;  
    print 0 '"
$ ./writelimiter "$POLICY"  /bin/bash -c 'echo qqq > www'
/bin/bash: www: Permission denied
$ ./writelimiter "$POLICY"  /bin/bash -c 'echo qqq > /tmp/www'
$ ./writelimiter "$POLICY"  /bin/bash -c 'echo qqq > /tmp/../tmp/www'
/bin/bash: /tmp/../tmp/www: Permission denied
$ ./writelimiter "$POLICY"  /bin/bash -c 'echo qqq > /dev/null'
$ ./writelimiter "$POLICY"  /bin/bash -c 'echo qqq > /dev/zero'
/bin/bash: /dev/zero: Permission denied
